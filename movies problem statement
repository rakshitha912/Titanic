The goal of this task is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a
passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset. This dataset
includes features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin, all of
which can be used to train a predictive model. The project involves handling and
preprocessing data, selecting key features, and applying machine learning
techniques to build a model that effectively classifies survival outcomes.r
